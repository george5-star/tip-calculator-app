## Overview

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Oh boy, I just realized that, I still have a long way to go on my javascript journey which is very encouraging.

### Continued development

Probably how to structure my code well.

### Useful resources

No resources needed, I challenged myself to do this challenge on my own, which is not exactly the best way but you know you've got to try new things.
